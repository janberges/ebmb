This  programs  solves  the  isotropic Eliashberg  equations  for  the  Hubbard-
Holstein model. The names  of the parameter files to be  processed are passed as
command-line arguments. The required file format is exemplified by 'example.in'.

Simply  run  'make', provided  recent  versions  of  Fortran compiler  and  Make
utility are installed. Compiler preferences may be adjusted in the Makefile.

Format of the bare (.dat) output files:

     double  mu*               |  Only if c is T:
    integer  status(Z, Delta)  |
    integer  n                 |     double  Delta0 (eV)
                               |    integer  status(Delta0)
  n doubles  omega (eV)        |    integer  N
  n doubles  Z                 |
  n doubles  Delta (eV)        |  N doubles  omega (eV)
                               |  N doubles  Re[Delta] (eV)
  character  c (T or F)        |  N doubles  Im[Delta] (eV)
