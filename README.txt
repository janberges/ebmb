This  programs  solves  the  isotropic Eliashberg  equations  for  the  Hubbard-
Holstein model. The names  of the parameter files to be  processed are passed as
command-line arguments. The required file format is exemplified by 'example.in'.

Simply  run  'make', provided  recent  versions  of  Fortran compiler  and  Make
utility are installed. Compiler preferences may be adjusted in the Makefile.


M a n u a l

The Einstein frequency  'omegaE', the Electron-phonon coupling  'lambda' and the
Coulomb pseudo-potential 'mu*',  which must be given in the  parameter file, are
understood as variables of the critical temperature

       omegaE           1.04 (1 + lambda)
  Tc = ------ exp ------------------------------
       1.2 kB     mu* + 0.62 lambda mu* - lambda

according to McMillan (1968) and Dynes (1972).

Format of the bare (.dat) output files:

    integer  status(Z, Delta)  |  Only if c is 'T':
    integer  n                 |
                               |    integer  N
  n doubles  omega (eV)        |
  n doubles  Z                 |  N doubles  omega (eV)
  n doubles  Delta (eV)        |  N doubles  Re[Z]
                               |  N doubles  Im[Z]
     double  phiC (eV)         |  N doubles  Re[Delta] (eV)
     double  mu*EB             |  N doubles  Im[Delta] (eV)
     double  Tc (K)            |
                               |     double  Delta0 (eV)
  character  c ('T' or 'F')    |    integer  status(Delta0)
